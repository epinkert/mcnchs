NOTES

*Most of the same stuff on the last one. I'll try to keep these notes shorter, as I made 
lots of notes and some of the changes you have done before. I also made a lot of comments. 

*IMPORTANT: All the recipes diplayed need to stay in their rows of three. That might be
harder to do but it is pretty nessecary. 

*For what gets displayed in the features, have a featured column in the SQL, automatically
set to 0, so when it is set to 1 it is displayed. 

*The sign out buttons don't work. 

*If you can't do the bookmarks, that's fine. Let me know so I can take it away though. Also,
there are two of those buttons, one with javascript. I explained that more in comments. 

*The filter doesn't work. 

*I recommend doing the recipes (single.php) by id number. 

*I think that is it. There is stuff like scripts being in functions but you already knew
that.

*If there's something you can't do let me know so I can mess with the front end. Thanks 
so much for doing this!!
